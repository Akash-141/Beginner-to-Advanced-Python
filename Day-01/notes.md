# Day 1: Introduction to Python and Programming

## 1. What is Programming?

Programming means giving instructions to a computer so it can perform tasks.

A computer only follows clear and exact instructions.  
Those instructions must be written in a programming language.

A program is simply a collection of instructions written in a programming language.
