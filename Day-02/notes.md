# Day 2: Installing Python and Setting Up Your Environment

## 1. What is the Python Interpreter?

Python programs run using something called the **Python Interpreter**.
The interpreter reads your code line by line and executes it.

Official documentation:
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html

## 2. Downloading Python

Download Python only from the official website:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Always use the latest stable version of Python 3.

## 3. Installing Python (Windows)

During installation:

- Check the box: "Add Python to PATH"
- Click Install

Why PATH matters:

PATH allows you to run Python from the terminal from any directory.

Reference:
https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html

## 4. Verifying Installation

Open Command Prompt or Terminal and type:

python --version

or

python3 --version

If installed correctly, you will see something like:

Python 3.x.x

## 5. Using Python Interactive Mode

Start Python by typing:

python

You will see:

>>>

Now try:

>>> print("Hello from interactive mode")

To exit:

>>> exit()

## 6. Running Python Files

Create a file named test.py and write:

```python
print("Python is working correctly")
```

Run it using:

python test.py

---

## 7. Installing VS Code (Recommended)

Download from:
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install the Python extension by Microsoft:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

---

## Practice Tasks

1. Install Python.
2. Check your Python version.
3. Create a file named day2_test.py.
4. Print three messages.
5. Run the file from the terminal.
